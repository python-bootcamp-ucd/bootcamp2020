## Welcome to Python Bootcamp 2020

Everything you need to successfully learn something from the workshop can be found on this website. 

Our goal is to give you a basic understanding of the structure of Python, what it can be used for, and provide with you the tools you need to learn anything else you might need. This workshop was developed for incoming graduate students who have no previous coding experience. Current graduate students and those with prior coding experiences are also welcome! Besides learning Python, this is a great chance to meet other graduate students at UC Davis who are not necessarily in your graduate group.

### Format
You do not need to download anything to get started. The majority of the workshop will use Jupyter Notebooks, which can be run from a browser with no downloads needed. Additional guidance on how to install and run Python on your computer will also be provided. 

This workshop will be held over Zoom on September 22, 23, and 24, with a bonus open session on September 25 for additional questions or troubleshooting. Each session will be 6-7 PM Pacific Time, followed by an hour of optional group work on the homework assignments in Zoom breakout rooms. Sessions will be recorded for anyone interested who cannot make those times (the breakout rooms will not be recorded, nor will the bonus session on September 25). 

Besides the hour of live teaching each day, there will be several YouTube/pre-recorded videos that will complement the content taught each day. Some videos we will recommend watching ahead of time, others should be viewed after that day's session. We will make it very clear which is which! 

To better cement concepts taught each day, a homework assignment will be given. The three assignments total will build on each other so that by the end, you will have finished a fun Python project! Our theme this year is climate. Stay tuned to see an example of a finished project.

00:43:58	Zachary Scott Buchanan:	Can you comment on the questions now?  I changed the settings in there.
01:07:54	Xiaoya Zhang:	Is the assignment later required for this training?
01:08:56	Zachary Scott Buchanan:	@Xiaoya it is not required, but it will give you some practice with the techniques, and help internalize them better.  This is a voluntary workshop, and nothing is required here.  Just optional activities to help aid learning
